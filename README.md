# Advanced-CC-Project-3---Community-Tool-Quiz.fridalaurvigenn.github.io

The community tool/quiz project is designed to explore and understand the day-to-day experiences of individuals who were assigned female at birth (AFAB). The term "AFAB" refers to "Assigned Female at Birth," recognizing that certain individuals were designated as female based on physical characteristics at birth.

In discussions about gender, "AFAB" acknowledges that gender identity is complex and diverse. Not all individuals who were assigned female at birth necessarily identify as women. Some may identify as non-binary, genderqueer, genderfluid, transgender, or with other gender identities beyond the binary concept of male and female.

By framing the project as an exploration of the "AFAB experience" rather than simply the "women's experience," the tool aims to be more inclusive and respectful of diverse gender identities. This approach recognizes and honors the unique experiences and identities of individuals who were assigned female at birth, fostering a space that respects and validates people of all gender identities. Ultimately, the project seeks to promote understanding, empathy, and inclusivity within the community.
