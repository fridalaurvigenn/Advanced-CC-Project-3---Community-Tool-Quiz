          <h2>Welcome to The AFAB Experience Quiz!</h2>
          <p>This quiz is designed to gather information about AFAB (Assigned Female at Birth) individual's day-to-day experiences. If you are not a AFAB individual you can, of course, take it yourself but also are encouraged to share it with someone you know that is. Additionally, just want to make it noted that there are some potentially triggering topics which include: discrimination, harrasment, unwanted attention, judgement, etc. </p>
            <p>Please take a moment to read each question carefully and provide your answers.  </p>
         <p>Your responses are anonymous and will be used for research purposes only.</p>
